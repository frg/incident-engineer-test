# API Test
The goal for this test is to eveluate basic skill levels revolving around the ability to integrate a third party API, design & create a custom API, while displaying an understanding of HTTP Requests.

## Requirements
- Use Git to keep track of your project
- Use the [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com/) to display a random advice slip on a simple HTML page
- Use the [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com/) to add the ability to search for advice slips and display them in a list
- The [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com/) should not be called from the HTML page. Integrate the API into your own custom API/MVC project. Your HTML page should call your own API which in turn calls the [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com/)
- Your project should handle API errors gracefully
- Your project should log any errors and any information that might be useful to debug said errors.
- Provide a sample HTTP Request directly towards your API

## Bonus
- Implement an authentication mechanism into your API
- Add API documentation to enable third-parties to integrate your API
- Use an SQL database to store an audit of all Advice Slips requested. Add the ability to list all audit records in your HTML page
- Add automated tests to your project
